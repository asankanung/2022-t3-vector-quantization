# Soundtrack Similarity using a Vector Quantization Model

Process of Program Simplified:
  - User Uploads Soundtrack file
  - Uploaded track is run through Librosa functions to extract music features
  - Feature data is run through our Vector Quantization model to find the closest soundtrack in the dataset
  - Display Name of most "similar" soundtrack
